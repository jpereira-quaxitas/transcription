Speaker 1 

Yeah, you got to put in the other table. Yeah, you have to put it on the other on, yeah. Are you sure this works? 

Speaker 

Yeah, it should. Talking to. I think that should. Be working. And then the audio. Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

If you came in and just from the. 

Speaker 

Sorry. OK, so that's why. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. So. It doesn't. 

Speaker 1 

You don't help. 

Speaker 5 

Can you hear me? 

Speaker 6 

Hey everyone. 

Speaker 

Sitting out. 

Speaker 3 

Hi Joe, how are you? 

Speaker 6 

Good. Good. I should. Uh, try and figure out how to get my. Background back up. 

Speaker 3 

Oh, but I've never seen the background of. Oh, actually it's comparing the screens. You guys have very fancy screens. I was asking a friend of mine from Citadel the other day which screens we should get for the office. And they were like, go for Dell. Which brands do you have out of interest? 

Speaker 6 

Good question, Dale. Yes. 

Speaker 3 

Well, OK. Well, that's a new fancy background as well. 

Speaker 6 

Nice. Yes. New new colors and branding. We can also go this way. See it? Can you see it? Let's see. This is the second one too. For some reason I'm doing a bad. Job choosing it. 

Speaker 3 

Uh oh, I probably prefer that. 

Speaker 6 

Yeah, right. A little darker. That's the contrast. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Yeah, exactly. It's it's better than the sort of like the one that looks like you're in front of glass. The whole the old one. Which is sort of like, yeah. But yeah, thanks very much for giving your time up today. I just wanted to introduce you to the team. Sorry. There's, like, so many of us, but I've already told everyone about you already, Joe. And you. And we're sort of instrumental in us or inspiring me to start clocks at us. And we just thought I'd bring the team on. Get them to introduce themselves to see you know what team you have working for you. All of them are very academically, bro. And also mainly you know the the most important thing is our hiring process as Ewan was part of that actually. So even met everybody and had a hand in in helping them hire them. And but he was also very interested in, in brew dogs, chicken wings as well. So and yeah and yeah, just wanted to do you want to quickly introduce yourselves. To to Joe. 

Speaker 7 

Hi Joe. My name is Anton. I just finished finance business at university. I'm very, very happy to be in part of the team. But Douglas is a great mentor and we're learning day by day in big proportions and I'm very happy to actually make a difference in industry. 

Speaker 2 

You should go next. I think my name is where I just finished my PhD in engineering bioengineering, specifically experimental biophysics, and now I've decided to venture a bit different than academia started looking at what's happening in the world. Very interested in what to finance. So this is definitely the. Feel that I was excited in and. Now I'm here. 

Speaker 1 

Alright, I think I can go next similar to zoo here. I also have an engineering background. I finished my degree at Imperial College of London for Electrical Engineering and I really liked obviously the the analytical part of the course, but I also spent a lot of time in the marketing role and I also love the people aspect of it. So this just seems like the perfect mix of both worlds for me. So I'm really excited. To be doing this. 

Speaker 4 

I can go ahead. My name is Christy and I just graduated from an anthropology degree in the London School of Economics with an anthropology degree. Obviously very interested in demographics, cultures, people kind of led me towards this, people driven role and I'm very excited to be starting. 

Speaker 6 

Ohh, you're coming in a little faint actually. 

Speaker 3 

Valerie, do you want to help Tegan sort out her? Her Mike and Lucy, you can quickly introduce yourself. 

Speaker 8 

Yeah, I can jump in as well. That's being sorted. I'm Lucy. I've just finished my anvil akin. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 8 

And history history of. Facebook 2 I yeah, I was very interested in a. Career that. Was with people was, you know? People driven helping people I was interested in the finance space as well. I had the legal background and I was kind of with the area I gravitated to. But yeah, and it's lovely to meet. You lovely to be here. Yeah, hopefully. You can. 

Speaker 6 

Nice to meet you too. 

Speaker 3 

For Larry, you would like to go next. I think you just might have to change your your source of your mic to you know the the Jabra headsets. Yeah. So Valerie you next? 

Speaker 5 

Yeah, sure. Hi, John. Valeria, I just finished the infill in Cambridge. I was in politics and International Studies, but I moved to the UK last year and before that I had experience working in Financial department of an executive search company. So this is technically my second time working in this industry. Very happy to meet you. 

Speaker 6 

Nice to meet you too. 

Speaker 3 

And just in case Tegan and Mike doesn't work, I can introduce her. But tegan. Do you want to try again? We've just got them new headsets, new Jabra headsets, but UM you know technology. Yeah, there's always something. Yes. Perfect. Yeah, that works. Yay. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 9 

Imperfect. Hi, Joe. It's nice to meet. You. I'm tegan. I just finished my masters and performance psychology at the University of Edinburgh, where I wrote my thesis on emotion mediated decision making and traders and that's why Jeremy proxy tests and this role. So yeah. 

Speaker 6 

Very nice, cool area. 

Speaker 3 

Right. And that's basically team, if you've got any questions for them, great. But I also wanted to sort of you know catch up on the on the roles. I mean if you've got any questions, the team feel free to ask them and and hopefully they haven't said bad things about the training last week. It's been a very, very heavy training week. You know, I've told them very good things. Too many. Involved and we're we're sort of, you know, aiming. To basically be. You know, just yeah out there as and very researched and all of us have research backgrounds. We are heavily sort of well this week we've been heavily investigating the commodities markets and also you know the D1 obviously and they're also helping out with the final QD at QRS as well. So I've been telling them about. One about you and they've met you and met also Francesco as well. Andre came. But then had to go home because he was staying with my and Paul's friends in London. So you had to go home very quickly. So they've met the rest of the team. Really. Got an idea of of. What Sanford stands for in general, especially Qis and yeah. 

Speaker 6 

Very awesome. Well, it's great to meet all of you. Nice to meet the whole team. Excited for what you'll all do. I think the firm's great. That is a wonderful mentor. I'm sure. Just I think he's one of the best in the space. So you're learning from 1:00. The best, and I think you all have great backgrounds for the work. It's pretty wonderful to have kind of the the academic background and the interest in people or the sciences. Often that's kind of the two pieces of this equation. It's like people oriented business in a science oriented. So yeah, I think that's a winning recipe just to introduce myself very briefly, I've been at John Paul 2 1/2 years. I'm on systematic BD, so I cover quantitative strategies. I also cover what's called tactical strategies. Tactical strategies are a little bit more of and driven in nature. So variable what we call net exposure, so kind of the overall book. Like tilt the positive or. If over time, depending on kind of the traders view so tactical can sometimes be a little less purely stats driven on the quant side or very stats driven, very systematic on the tactical side process driven but not all processes are quantitative processes like it can be a little bit more just structured around investment. Process basically so strategies there might include volatility, ARB D1 index rebalance kind of. Classic strategies that that fit in that space and we're we're pretty active in that area right now. So you know maybe disappointingly so for some of the more want oriented folks we're doing a lot more hiring around D1 lately, which we have a build big build going on. Led by this former partner Goldman Sachs, Ricardo Ribald. It's going to be, you know, obviously classic D1 in in developed markets, but also a large emerging market bent to it as well. So the rough idea there is there's the MSCI emerging market index, right. This is something that is client traded at the banks and then you can kind of trade prop around it, right, so. When you think about the potential markets there, they roughly reflect reflect the rough weights of the MSCI EM. So you can kind of like look at that to get a rough sense of the directions. We're going in. Geographically, we're still set wise. We've been hiring PMS in a number of different areas around that strategy. So like there's actually a weird amount of interest in dividends. So there is something called the dividend. Future people trade. It from the index level and the singles level. There are also some strategies around index rebalance, which is another big one often stand alone. The street. So that's a big area. We're pretty well hired and developed market media. We've been doing a lot more work in APAC lately. So that's a big push for us. We're also still hiring Quant Strat talent for that team as well. So kind of looking for rates client, I can try it. Since I'm updated, they're kind of informal JDS. I need to kind of formalize them a little bit more, and then I'll send them over. In commodities, we're actually looking for a stats quant like in that area. So someone a little bit more statistically oriented to robustified the process of testing signals for one of our commodities quants. So that's another open search. We're looking for an intermediate index rebalance. Analyst slash researcher in Hong Kong Doug knows that one well sent a few candidates that way, but still still kind of an open, very passive search for us. Yeah. And that's kind of it. You know, at a high level on the business, maybe to scope out the business, we have about 25 PM's on the quant side. We have about 10:00 PM's on the tactical side, although we have a huge tactical build going on right now that will kind of increase that significantly. So depending on how you count them, it might be significantly more than 10. We have about 10 billion of external capital. We have over 900 internal employee. These spread across kind of four major verticals. I kind of talked about two, one is Quant, one is tactical. That's kind of our business development coverage. They're separate BD teams covering fundamental equity as well as discretionary macro. So those are two different buckets for our firm as well. We're kind of been around for a long time. This is our 35th year of operation. We were originally a prop trading group run prop for a number of years up until 2016 when we started opening up to outside capital. Kind of grew across a number of dimensions across strategies across kind of risk geographies, personnel diversification across geographies. And of course, strategy, strategy, diversification. So that's that's kind of us in a rough nutshell and a couple of the jobs at a very high level and then happy to kind of work more closely with you as we kind of get into the weeds on these things. 

Speaker 3 

One immediate question is in terms of. You know, reminding them about the D1. So that's across, you know APAC and also London as as well, if I remember correctly. 

Speaker 6 

Correct. The biggest areas of hiring are in London, Dubai and Hong Kong from like this is where people sit perspective. But you know we've been looking at candidates in LATAM like in Sao Paulo region, but that got kind of kicked back to Q 1/20/24. Circling back on that. US will happen at some point down the line, but you know we're we're pretty good there. The really the focus lately has been on kind of sourcing better APAC candidates, especially around special sets and ECM. 

Speaker 

OK. OK. 

Speaker 3 

OK. And in terms of the commodities strats want, that's something that also aligns with what we're working on for early housing at the moment. So is that a a separate team within London within where does the commodities strike wants it? 

Speaker 6 

But there might be some chance Edinburgh would work. 

Speaker 3 

Oh, OK. May I ask why? 

Speaker 6 

The PM straddles both places, so it's possible. Yeah, which I think someone here was university there. 

Speaker 3 

Ah, OK. So she's like, yeah. 

Speaker 

Well, usually. 

Speaker 3 

So yeah, Keegan and I used to visit there a lot to play, but I've never actually. Yeah, that's very good whiskey bar, which I just went in between concerts. 

Speaker 6 

Looks beautiful, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

But it was just like. Yeah, just very brief, but yeah. OK. And in terms of other quant, are there any specific, I'm just looking at the last sheets you sent over, I'm just wondering if there are any. I remember there was some C plus or staff for this 7-8 capital. Stuff or potentially. 

Speaker 6 

Yeah, there's another dev like either a director of development or a senior developer, but that might get repurposed into some like retention like that, that piece of budget might get repurposed into kind of some retention things, so we'll see. 

Speaker 3 

But trying to never find the C guy. 

Speaker 6 

But yeah. They found a couple very on the more junior side. So they've been doing a lot. They love hiring from like via Kohl's, like French people in London. Basically they love cube square point profiles, but yeah, so they're open to kind of more senior sub PM type. Researchers like you know, folks who. It's kind of a nice play in the niche play in the sense like, you know, if they make kind of 1 to 5 million in P&L, they're to be too small. Normally for most places, but they'd be willing to work with them to kind of expand out the P&L and often learn something in the process from kind of going into a new space. So that could be useful and like they love again square point and cube. Profiles. But really any top tier shop for the more experienced side for the developer side, they've been hiring a lot out of like undergrad or masters programs like computational Sciences type programs. Usually undergrad at one of like the French schools that they, you know, they love that like process basically the the French students have to go through. So that's usually a must for them. But yeah, they hired, they just hired someone pretty recently and they have another person joining in December that's been on a one year sit. So they're they're still open there, there, but the hiring has gone relatively well on that. 

Speaker 3 

Side fantastic how? How about Adam at 7-8? 

Speaker 6 

Haven't heard much from them lately. On the hiring side. I know they've been pretty busy with their launch. They've launched A standalone fun, so that's probably taking a lot of. 

Speaker 3 

Their focus, and also just perhaps not under your remit recently there was a guy. Who was ex head of credit strategies at Mann and then on the discretionary side and then more on the systematic side. So we build out the systemic side in London and realized he could do it by himself. So 11/20/21 and has been building his own front. Is that something that? Trump might be interested in, OK. 

Speaker 6 

Send our way. You know, it would be like it. Usually we prefer exclusive deals, so, but we can explore that. 

Speaker 3 

OK. Yeah, I'm still building up. We came into the office this morning and it was something about basically umm rather than trading them bonds themselves, doing it via ETF and hedging it as such. And he basically there's we're still looking into details as to whether or not you know the models are good. But I mean coming from man and being head of both. Discretion and systematic. You know, one would think that he would rape, but yeah, we're still scoping out the effectiveness of his sort of ETF strategy. So yeah. 

Speaker 6 

OK, cool. Yeah, take a look. 

Speaker 2 

Right. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I think that's basically I've put down as much notes as possible. I don't want to keep you on, but does anyone have any sort of good targeted questions for Joe? In the public. Very scared. 

Speaker 7 

Sorry, I just have one. Maybe it's not too relevant to your expertise, but I'm I was wondering whether the different offices in different locations have different functions except for the markets that they cover. 

Speaker 6 

That's a good question. You know you you tend to have some leanings, maybe like a lot more of the tech team is in the US, but usually with PM coverage, it's global. So you really want a lot of the teams Co located in each region so that they can support them across time zones. But yeah, so for the most part, it's pretty geographically dispersed. With some. Small like specialization, usually like if there's a senior person on tech in Miami, like maybe certain kind of tech will may be done in Miami. But yeah, we basically hire out of all the offices on the investment function. Very open. So those offices would be for us, New York, Miami, we have small offices in like San Francisco and Austin or maybe not Austin. Maybe it's Dallas, actually. Sorry, one in Chicago as well. So we can kind of make us is like workable like if the P&L may sort of makes sense. And then it depends on the team. Some teams are very. Know about remote work. Some teams like prefer everyone in the same office in the New York area, we have an office in Summit, NJ, and Stamford, CT, and obviously the core New York office, we have our Miami office. We have a Dubai office, London with about 130 people, a Hong Kong office with about 80, Singapore. Office with 40 small Tokyo office and a small Sydney office as well. So that's kind of. The rough locations we're in. 

Speaker 7 

Thank you. 

Speaker 2 

No problem. 

Speaker 7 

What does no one else has a question. Can I, can I ask a question about a little bit in terms of financial knowledge, understand that we don't need to teachers, but in terms of you mentioned dividend futures, how do dividend futures move relative to features that are connected to the relevant equity, would they be? 

Speaker 1 

Last question about. 

Speaker 7 

Less volatile, more volatile. 

Speaker 6 

Good question. I mean, there's some, there are a couple things that drive them maybe in the short term there are things around flow. So there are certain like exotic products where they have like a leftover dividend risk that needs to be hedged. So sometimes that happens directly through the futures and the future is like a future on the dividend of an index, right? Or sometimes a stock and it can be out multiple years. So it could be the SMP dividend 5 years from now or something like. That right? And so they often tend to be slightly. Press and so people might buy them for some sort of convergence trade because of, like, this natural flow. Then they're sort of other drivers of these things. Right? So, like, what happens? What's the normal profile of a dividend? A dividend's, pretty steady, steady, steady. And then in eight, maybe people start. Aggressively cutting their dividends to conserve cash, right? So it has this, it almost carries like short Val, where it kind of earns, earns earns and then drops precipitously. From like a fundamental perspective, right? And so there is some implicit beta that kind of occurs at the tails, so it does kind of carry some equity like risk and like measuring that relationship can be a little slippery and maybe a function of your assessment of. This kind of tail event I would also say that for certain dividends like European dividends tend to be more crowded cuz there are a lot of big players kind of running these trades so. You know, people run out the door at the same time, so they kind of also come with some left tail, wrist just from like a flow crowding perspective too. 

Speaker 

If we were. 

Speaker 7 

To give you a candidate for to do with dividend dividend futures, you would have to have exact experience in this. Or is there any relevant experience or expertise that are kind of similar? 

Speaker 6 

Good question. I mean like so sometimes you get that risk from a classic D1 seed. Sometimes you get it from like an exotics desk or something like that. So like maybe candidates on both sides might have some experience there. I would say usually that risk is transferred to the D1 desk, so that's usually where it's like warehoused and handled. It's kind of unique. So I would say, like for the junior side, maybe we'd be more open to folks with a slightly more diverse background. But there's it's such a common skill set because every bank kind of needs to handle this. Dividend risk that we probably should just target folks that fit the bill exactly. 

Speaker 7 

OK. Thank you. 

Speaker 6 

Yeah, no problem. 

Speaker 3 

Great. Somebody else with questions. No, all good. OK, great. So I think obviously Joe has told us a lot about the, the, the other one thing. So we can definitely research that this week also in our in our, in our own own time outside of work as well as we can really understand this this space. And obviously you know the. The technicals of it as Anton themselves of it have a good understanding of it as well. Uh. Commodities. We're already working on. So you guys know about that. So we can we can help with that as well and just for. Balancing our cover with you. Guys later show do you have any more questions for us? 

Speaker 6 

No, I mean, just like as someone who also was recently learning the D1 space. If you're talking to candidates, sometimes it can be hard like. Sometimes when you're at a loss for questions like sticking to the basics can be really helpful. Like what products are you covering? What sort of are there? Are they derivatives or are they like the cache instruments and then even asking them what does your day-to-day look like? Because often like on the desk they have like a certain workflow and you can kind of back into. What they actually do versus what they're telling you they do. It's often hard to fake a whole day's schedule. So sometimes that can be like a helpful starting point for most. 

Speaker 3 

One hour coffee and one hour coffee and button breaks actually. So do you remember Cody Fisher? So I'm gonna. I'm gonna try to see if I can ask him to do because he gave me a like, an hour long. D1 lecture once, several months ago. So I might, you know, draw upon his skills again and try to get him to give us some. Some and and even Vettori as well. So that could be that could be fun, yeah. Do you someone to replace the? 

Speaker 6 

Tour. I think we have the person. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

That's fine. So that's something you don't have to worry about. 

Speaker 6 

Great. You find a strong candidate, send them along. But we think we have someone soft circled. Let's put it that way. 

Speaker 3 

Well, I guess we can. OK, OK, that's completely fine. Great. There's one person who for the commodity Strat position who I will send along right now. He's in London, just got an offer from DWI, but still interviewing with with he. He was interviewing with Citadel, but also doing Balyasny at the moment and .72 and Millennium. So basically all the top commodity, while the top three commodities teams in London and die. Sure, actually as well actually. So I will send that across right now. You haven't spoken to you, I've already checked. So I will forward that. Right now. Awesome, thanks. OK, great. Well, thank you very much for your time, Joe, and sorry for overcrowding you with so many faces, but yeah, hoping that you know I can keep on training them, do a great job. And yeah, really keep on impressing really. 

Speaker 2 

Great. Well. 

Speaker 6 

Well done, I mean and one last thing like that, proactivity is great cuz he heard about this. At the start of this meeting and he already checked that that person hasn't spoken with us and is following up already so. Everyone was like that. We'd be in a. Very good state. 

Speaker 3 

Well, I'm trying to. Hopefully I'm not being too harsh on them, but The thing is, The thing is, we've got actually a very great team who not only works well, but actually gets along very, very well. But then. You know it's it's. Yeah, it's absolutely. So I won't take much of your time. Guys, please say thanks to Joe. He's given up his time for us and it's been wonderful and UM, yeah, hopefully we'll just come up with the results for Joe and keep him happy. 

Speaker 

Your time today. 

Speaker 6 

So nice to meet you. 

Speaker 3 

I'll see you later. Bye. 

Speaker 

Good so.
