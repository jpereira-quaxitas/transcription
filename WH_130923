Speaker 1 

I can totally. I can totally see the frustration and from the perspective of somebody that or in a company that's trying to, you know, find their niche going against the, the, the standard of doing that practice, it really is frustrating because what happens is not the company is. Most of the. Times. The good thing is that if you're working with us, we have the, the partners that we have within these companies, you should be allowed to get override. If we say, well, this candidate unfortunately was put this TV out without them being know without them knowing. And so there's in some situations, for example, cubis being one of those. Or I mean, there's a couple of them. I have a a list over here, but there's a couple of partners. Where? We kind of. Have a little bit of a trouble. Oh, no. This candidate is good and they'll relook at it. But unfortunately, most firms just don't provide that kind of leniency. So unfortunately, the miscommunication that you mentioned happens way too often in this space, and so we really just want to rest assured that that is not the the ethos that we go off of. And we really do check with you before anything that we do. Yeah. And especially because. Each company has its own different like targets, so it's important if you want to succeed, to be able to tailor each application for the specific company, not just do like one CV, push them all to everywhere. All everything is done the same for everything. Cookie Cutter method, which just doesn't work in reality. But yeah, so in terms of being able to being able to help you a little bit further, it's important that we know that which companies you have been sent out to because obviously the reason why they send out even without your permission is because once the CV is in the the database of whatever company. Whichever recruitment company sent that is the one that will get the firm and doesn't matter whether you apply yourself after it. They were the first ones to send it and that's how it works. And so for us to provide you with quality opportunities, I will need to know which of the firms you have already been sent out to. UM. So is is that is that in some sort of information that you could obtain? 

Speaker 2 

I can. I can try, I mean I guess like you know. I feel like there's no way I would know, like if they sent it to a certain company and the company didn't reach out to. But also you said like a one year or like this was last September. So it was like right around a year ago. So if? If they sent it out to someplace like a year ago, and then you send it, you send a new resume now that. Like does the first one still count or what? Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. So the one of one, one year cool, cool period. That's a rule of thumb. Obviously some companies have different policies is all internal, but it definitely would be something that is possible if it's on a year ago now obviously it they would see your name come up again and so. Who knows how their algorithms are structured in their recruitment process of how they look through the CVS, but luckily the the clients that we have, we usually are able to put them forward with with like our stamp of approval saying, oh, this is a good candidate and that differs from the ones that are just sent out by any or incent by by themselves or. Any of the precursor, just spend lot CVS, but what would be helpful is that if you could send me, even if it's just they say you got the emails of the response from any company, if you could just send me the month and the year where you receive that so I can get a good idea about when exactly the application application was sent out. Then I can get a good. Like idea of what which companies you still are available for and then you can kind of proceed from there. 

Speaker 2 

OK, so you want to know which companies emailed me and when. 

Speaker 1 

It's essentially the the ones that every company that you have already been applied or represented or applied yourself. If you could create a little list of that with the month and the year where that was obviously a rough idea would be enough. That would be. 

Speaker 2 

I I think, yeah, it's going to be. A lot of them if, like. Last September also counts. But yeah, I'll just send them to you and then you can see if there. Are any others? 

Speaker 1 

Sure. Yeah. I mean there probably will be. And again the good thing is that we have Direct Line communication with the line managers that are hiring, which is something that most recruiters don't have. And that's one of the the leading reasons why as consultants, we have a much better. Kind of. Way to get the good candidates. I've seen your CV and I see that you have an incredibly good background to kind of succeed in this industry. So with the help of us, it's really is a possibility to kind of fix the situation. But in terms of that, like I just want to quickly ask a couple more questions just so I can kind of just. Finish up my like just getting get an idea about what your qualities are. I see that you've done quite a bit of work with Python as well as a couple of other things. How would you rate your knowledge in these different yeah, different programming languages? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, so Python is my language. Like. Yeah, I don't know C or C++. I mean, I guess I'm like, I know a little bit of Java, but that's that's going back in. Number of years. So yeah, basically I'd be up on the Python positions or. Places who? Like are willing to like train me out basically. So so you feel comfortable. 

Speaker 1 

Taking a test in Python. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I I. Feel older than that. I like. I don't know exactly how that classify my level like I guess I would probably. Intermediate or something? OK. 

Speaker 1 

OK, alright, that's great. And in terms of your location, I I mean I know you're right now you're working remotely in Wisconsin, but you your job is based in New York, is that you're are you planning on just staying in New York or would you be? Willing to relocate. To Chicago or, I don't know, even outside of the US. Is that something you have looked into? 

Speaker 2 

I think I want to stay inside the US, but Chicago is definitely fine. Also, like I I don't have a clear preference between New York and Chicago. If anything, I would maybe link to Chicago, but yeah, definitely open to the. 

Speaker 1 

Is there a reason why? Like just out of curiosity. 

Speaker 2 

I mean, Chicago is in the Midwest, it's a lot closer. So I, you know, not starting. Ohh very nice. 

Speaker 1 

How? I mean excuse if this is a bit of European ignorance, but how far is it between Wisconsin and Chicago and New York and Chicago? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So Chicago from here is so driving it would be like 2 hours. It's pretty, pretty close. You know, on the bus, maybe three hours and then like, flying to New York would. Yeah. Be like a. Two hour flight or something, either from here or from Chicago, although a lot of the flights. A lot of the time that people fly from here, they like, take a bus to. Chicago and then fly so. Yeah, Chicago is definitely easier to get to from. 

Speaker 1 

Here. Yeah. No, that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. OK. That's pretty cool. Yeah. In terms of weather as well, I don't think between New York and Chicago, probably. I know winter is. And both of them are pretty intense. So that's not really a big factor. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, it's not a huge different chain factor. I think the Chicago winters would be a little more intense. But you know, probably not huge difference from New York, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Alright. And in terms of if you don't mind me asking in terms of salary expectation, umm, what is it the ballpark that you're kind of looking into? 

Speaker 2 

So honestly, I don't see that. Yeah, I kind of doubt that it's going to be like be like the deciding factor like. I I feel like probably all these places play pretty well and I'm. More interested in. Yeah, like interesting work with. The collaboration and the culture and that sort of stuff. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Well, well, well, I can. I can tell you that from what you just said, then Citadel is definitely the one that's renowned for being able to offer good packages. But then once you're there, almost like selling your soul where most people just like. Hate the people they're reporting to hate the culture there, but they're getting a good package, so it's. I'm glad that your priorities aren't in the money because that is. How most people that succeed this from that you know people that chase money usually take the wrong decisions, go like blindly follow where the money takes them. And that usually doesn't work out. Well, in the long term. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. I mean, I've heard some people say that about that a lot. I've also heard that like depends on the team that you're on. So that that's like. But why? I'm still going through the process because you know, I figure out. To just try to make that judgment myself, but because you also interview with the teams, so can just see during the process like what the team. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. One thing that's important to know and I'm sure you already know this, but in terms of the non compete. When you do, when you do start out with these firms, that's one thing that you've got to be very careful. With is that they'll try to. I know kind of pose a very long compete. I've I've seen some people with two year non compete which basically means that you're like if you end up going to let's say citadel and you go to a bad team and the culture there is horrible you see no career progression even if you've been there like six months you still have to wait. Two years until you can join. Join back the industry. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, two years is crazy. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. No. Yeah, from from the perspective, there's there's so many people that have done one year in the career and then have to wait two years until they can do something else. 

Speaker 2 

I mean presumably they got like a software job or something, right, like you? Literally no work, right? It's just not. 

Speaker 1 

Exactly. Yeah, yeah. The usually the non compete. Obviously they'll change within the different contracts, but you'd be surprised sometimes they do pose very like significant limitations, especially because if you do want to rejoin back the field after two years, who knows how much has changed and who knows if your experience is relevant enough to be able to keep on track. What your competitors are with your with people that are applying and so that's another big reason why we especially are helpful because not only do we just kind of help you take to the right companies, but once you do get once you do get these the contracts and all those things we. To help people. Make sure that they're not getting into a. Contract, that is. Not suitable because that I think is one of the. Most common problems, especially with recent PHD's and like people in the early in their careers, is that they just don't have enough of the. I guess you could call it the market experience to know what is a good contract for a bad contract, and I can't speak for myself because. I haven't been doing this stuff for a long time. But my the director that started this company like he, he almost has a skill of being able to look at control. Yet this this clause over here is going to screw you over. And then if you're able to point that out like Oh no, I want to kind of change that up. It's one of those things that is really, really helpful to to to know before you do sign anything. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. No, that's a good point. Yeah, I should probably mention I I do have like a non compete for my current position. It's just like three months. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

And it also. I don't know if most of. Them are like this but. Like it doesn't automatically take effect, it's only two signal lights to, you know, enforce it, I guess. And so I have no idea like if they would choose to. Do that so I mean, cause especially I've been working on the private side. You know, the jobs we're talking about. Assume we're on the public so. Yeah, I just don't know if they would do that, but hopefully three months is not like a big deal anymore. 

Speaker 1 

And do you happen to know if you say 2 months or three months? Three months. And did you say those three months? Does it start after the contract is finished in mid like around September or is it, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I believe it would just start at the. End of. Appointment. So yeah, sorry around November 1st and then end around February 1st. And so again, that's if they choose to enforce it. Yeah, they will. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, assuming from the kind of worst case scenario that they do in force, that would mean that roughly your start date would at late at latest be 2nd of February. 

Speaker 2 

Ohh and also. Yeah, I believe it all set like. You know, you didn't say. Like like. I don't know if this is what most non computers are like, but it said something like if I do work during that period then they just won't pay me but like. It didn't seem like. It's like legally binding or that they would like sue me or something. I don't know if that's normal, but in other words, if there were a company that has like a training program for new tires starting in January like. Unless I'm misunderstanding the contract like, I would totally just like start that in January and. Yeah, but I don't think that. Would be an. 

Speaker 1 

Issue but yeah. 

Speaker 2 

I mean, yeah, these details like. I I can like, you know, obviously double check. If it comes. 

Speaker 1 

Through it? Exactly. Yeah. It's one of those things. We'll see if, if. If it comes to something like that, then it's one of things you can double check before, before anything. Yeah, just another. This is more of general questions. I see you've published quite a lot of stuff. I'm just generally interested, like I said, I I did a a degree in, in, in electric engineering. So a lot of these things do seem very interesting to me. And you're like any publications relevant in the space or skills that you would be transferable? 

Speaker 2 

So on the first point, sort of directly relevant, I think I just have to say no, like it would be cool, but. Yeah. No, I mean I. Her skills like. Yeah, like it, it feels. Like their transferable skills, which I guess is. People hire like math PhD service work. So I mean yeah, it feels to me. You know the the curiosity that like it cultivated and the like, ability to dive deeply into, like quantitative problems. The ability to light. You know, given. Just like some unstructured information like come up with like. Sort of. I know the right way to think about it and the right. Or at least like useful problems to to pose. Give him like. Because, yeah, I mean like. In my. Course where it's like you're like giving her problems. Then you do the problems. But I think the advantage of research, the way it is, a closer match of the real world, is that, like no one tells you what the questions are and like coming up with useful questions I think is like really important, like both. Research and. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Yeah. No, that that's definitely very, very important. Yeah. No, that that's I think that's all my questions I have for you. Do you have any questions for me or just in general any questions about the space? 

Speaker 2 

Well, I guess I'm wondering like which firms? Like you work with? Yeah. I don't know if you're able. 

Speaker 1 

To share, so we do work with a lot of companies. I'm not allowed to share an extensive list of all of them, but a lot of the, the the companies that you mentioned are some of our partners. We work everything from you know the largest ones. And the. In in the industry to use startups and stuff, we we're working right now with the stealth startup focusing in commodities. So we do have a lot of opportunities and the in terms of being able to provide names, that's one of those things. Usually when we have an opportunity that we think you're suitable, that's when we start approaching with names. I am. But it yeah it for for profile like yours is definitely there's a lot of suitability. The only thing really now is for us to have an idea about which companies, which firms you will already have applied to. So we can kind of either look into what it is that we can do in regards to those and look at the ones that you haven't applied to and. See your fit for those. So definitely if if you can do this sometime today or tomorrow or. Anytime soon. So we can kind of get that process and then we can meet again at the end of this week or potentially next week. I know you're busy right now, but yeah, so we can then move on and start discussing the actual opportunities that we can start preparing you for. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, sounds good. And so just to double check like for places that I just submitted an online application for, I guess there's like nothing. Nothing that you can do with that at this point, even if you work with them. 

Speaker 1 

Unfortunately not. It's again. This is all I I I can. I can definitely check with the the Managing Director of my company, which is the ones that really has the the direct lines to to these managers because obviously in certain situations he will be able to. Get things sorted, but that's that. That's why, if if I get the list, I will then discuss with them and then next week we can talk about this, whether there is something we can do, never say never but usually like. Unfortunately The thing is once it's out there, it's in the data. Web-based and so we can't really do anything but that. That being said, we're still more than happy to help you prepare for the interview that comes to it. Like we said, we we're not, we're not here just to try to make money. We're really are here to find the best opportunity for you. And so I can give you a perfect example a couple of days ago there was a candidate that was in between. Going into a job as a QR or doing his PhD. And we were going to get commissioned if you went to the PhD job. But sorry if you went to the quant job, but his profile just suited more the PhD and he just seemed like he wanted to go. And even though it was not in our financial interest to tell him yet, he should the pH. D that is what we advised them because we know that maybe not right now but in the future. This advice will help him to go where he wants to be and so that again like I like I've said a couple of times already, that is kind of. The ethos that. We got off of. So even if you've already applied by yourself or with other recruiters, we are still always here to help and answer any questions and guide you through the process. Player we really hope it becomes like a football fruitful partnership for both of us. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. No, I appreciate that. And uh. Yeah, I. It's nice to hear that there is a place that's taking like a longer view after some of my experience where it seems like some people are just trying to get like the next Commission. And yeah, I mean, I hope you know, as I said, I've already applied some places but like. Like you guys seem like a good place for. Like future application cycles as well. So I'm yeah hoping that. We can work together in the future. 

Speaker 1 

As well, sure. I mean I'm. I'm very happy to hear that. And so in that case, if there's any other questions that you might have right now is, is there anything you you'd like to ask before we go? 

Speaker 2 

Ah, no, I don't think so. I can. Yeah. Do my best to gather that list of, you know, which places have seen my CV at some point. Like when? And then I guess at that point you can let me know. If there are any other firms. 

Speaker 1 

Sure, that that sounds good. So in that case, how about if we can try to get that done within the next couple of days and let's say, would you, would you have availability on Monday, next Monday? 

Speaker 2 

I think so. Yeah. I I think I'm pretty free Monday. Nothing to mind is. 

Speaker 1 

OK. For if we could possibly do Monday, perhaps a little bit earlier that would be ideal. We can just, I'll send you my my calendar link that actually works because it was being an issue with the with the server. That we have today, so I'll get that sorted and I'll get that over to you. So we can then meet again and I'll be with my my Managing Director next time because he can help you provide some more expertise that regarding the firms that we saw. Sounds great. OK. Well, thank you so much, will, for taking the time to call. I'll send you my WhatsApp number through LinkedIn in case if it's easier for you to reach out there. And I'll also send you a little like candidate preparation packets, which is useful for for any kind of application that you do include some books. If you're interested in learning more about the space and just different resources that will help in applying for jobs, send that over as well, and then if you can send over like that, we said the the list of different firms to my e-mail and then we'll schedule another call for next Monday. 

Speaker 2 

Alright, sounds good. Yeah. Yeah, good to meet. 

Speaker 1 

You good to meet you as well. Have the rest of a. Good day and I'll see you soon, OK? 

Speaker 2 

Right. 

Speaker 1 

Alright. Bye bye. Take care.
