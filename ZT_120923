Speaker 1 

You know, I I kind of like programming, but mainly to well to apply it to something and along the way I also got to know more about this. Theoretical background of it and I I got to enjoy that part too. But yeah, so machine learning is is a very hot topic. I got interested in it like. Beginning of 2022 and then I just had this quite a long time to prepare for this degree or for this program more like and. Yeah, it seem to they seem to have valued it. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that's great. That's really great and. In terms of Quant. Is that where you see yourself going after? 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, so this summer I'm I'm doing this quant research internship and I kinda. I like it. A lot. So it was a very good experience. I didn't really know what I was getting into cuz I I heard a lot about this that you know, very bright maths people just go do this. I was like this probably is very boring and it's it's quite bad, but no. So I I I really enjoy it. It's it's like you know, it's very clever people doing also. Sort of math. See stuff together. I mean, here at world, everyone is quite humble as well, and it's just. Yeah, I feel quite at home. You know, it's like maps, talent camp, basically just the whole day. So yeah, yeah, definitely see myself going into this direction. Although I wouldn't say that I'm not open to doing other things related to ML. If the opportunity arises, so yeah, there's my I'm kind of opening, you know, another door for myself with this ammo thing as well because right now to go into the software engineer machine learning engineer or maybe researcher direction is they don't really believe you that you can do the computing. Parts well enough, so they will just go with a computing student. So you know, with this I suppose I will have more options, but yeah, this is definitely. Maybe something I enjoy now and I will look look into later. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Well, from my perspective, I deal with a lot of people that like to go into the Quan space and someone that has done maths and computer science or sorry, sorry, maths and then machine learning or a subject like that is a great combination of both worlds. As you know, Quant finance is exactly that, right. It's being able to apply mathematical models into algorithms that will. We'll get a solved problem in the in the finance industry. And so you. Said that you. You liked the the culture world content. Is that right? 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah, I like it a lot. And I. Also, so work on this kind of. How to say they are using some new ideas? You know it's it's not like they are afraid of using machine learning to to do stuff. So I was basically using e-mail this summer too. There's some more conservative like, I don't know, let's say Citadel. I mean, they told me that they don't use this kind of stuff. They just use more traditional techniques, so I think this is also partly why I enjoy this so much right now and that they are also pretty chill. You know, the office is. Nice. It wasn't too strict. 

Speaker 2 

At all. And how was the? How was the work life balance? 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, that's what I'm saying it was. Very good. So like they they they. 

Speaker 2 

Ohh nice. 

Speaker 1 

They didn't. They weren't strict at all. I mean, OK, it was sad that we can't work from home normally. I mean based because we are interns and yeah, let's just go in because it's it's more useful. But yeah. You know, if you did the job, it's just it was enough and. Yeah, I don't know. 

Speaker 2 

And did and did you think it was like pushing you enough in terms of, you know, from all I I have seen you done a lot and you ranked very well in your cohort. So I'm guessing for you it takes a lot of stimulation to get for it to be mentally challenging. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah, it was quite tough, to be honest. Most of the time it was very tough to to come up with something and I just felt like it burned so much, like brain power, that I focused more than. Five to six hours, like full focus a day. And that's what I mean. That after that, I just felt like, you know, I couldn't do anything new or like cause. The the job was wasn't really like, you know, repeating and doing the same kind of stuff. So after like 6 hours I could have said there, you know doing nothing. But I was just like, yeah, I mean. I can. I can just go home and it. 

Speaker 

It was you. 

Speaker 1 

Know it was fine. So this is what I I. Liked about it? That so if you. Just did well. And you know, I I didn't feel like doing anything more because. Yeah, and I just. Yeah, it was very chill. So yeah. But it was definitely stimulating and also kind of exciting as exciting as finance can get, I suppose so, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I could totally agree. And so in terms of well, did you were you able to get a return offer or what was your kind of where did I go off of? 

Speaker 1 

Well, here you know, everyone is so chilled that basically it's like, yeah, yeah, I was. I was actually accepted for the full time job originally in like, December. And they told, and I told them that, you know, it could just be an internship because I will probably do your masters. But at that point, I was like. Open to do full time as well and they said OK. I mean, I just decide in March or something. So I decided to do that and then they also asked me during the summer if I want to stay up after that. I told them that I'm doing the masters and then they. Just said that. Yeah, I mean, you know, you can just come whenever you want. So I mean that's how I how I kind of feel about it. It's it's very. It's a very open conversation with them and yeah. 

Speaker 2 

No, definitely. And I think that's a great position from your perspective, because if you if you do like the learning aspect of it, especially if you're interested in ML, it's definitely worth taking that extra year to spend some time and gather those skills. And if you want to come back to the Quan space, you'll be prepared even more. Yeah, tools to succeed. Whether in Word count or there's so many options available, and that's kind of where our role comes in because we have a lot of knowledge within the different quant firms. So we'll be able to guide you into the ones that suit your profile best and and kind of with that in mind. 

Speaker 

In the business conference is the one. 

Speaker 2 

I'm going to. I think it's Douglas. I think the the echo of the the microphone is going back, OK. 

Speaker 

I see. 

Speaker 2 

Sorry about that. It's the the microphones a bit. Weird, but yeah, so kind of with that. That that being said in. Terms of just more on the technical side of it, I see that you've done some things with programming. Can you tell me how you would categorize yourself in the different languages like in terms of expertise? 

Speaker 1 

Well, so I mainly work in Python like I have never done like a big project or something in anything else. So yeah, and then Python I'd say that I'm like quite expert at this point like whole summer. I was doing Python. OK, I was doing some work. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Once you know in your system things but. That's not very general and it's quite niche and new. So I would say that, yeah, I I have most experience with Python, but when I had to do something in other languages, you know, I could pick. It up quite quickly. I mean, even this summer, you know, using their systems. Yeah, it got me. It took me some some time to get used to it, but it was quite quick. So I think, yeah, but Python is, is it? It is mainly. 

Speaker 2 

Sure. To the point where you'd feel. Comfortable taking a test right? You'll be here. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, like a test. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. 

Speaker 2 

Great, OK. And this is obviously looking ahead, but since you're going to be doing now a degree in in Cambridge, do you see yourself then working in the UK after or do you want to go back to Hungary or stay in the EU or what's the yeah? 

Speaker 1 

To be honest. I would want to stay in the UK. For at. Least a few more years, so UK I think first. France and then after that you, I mean, I don't want to go back to Hungary immediately, necessarily. So yeah, I think Netherlands. Yeah. I mean, there's some opportunities there definitely is, is in play. Yeah, but yeah, UK UK for. 

Speaker 2 

And the and the US never appeal. 

Speaker 1 

So US I never applied there. I mean, partly because of, you know, all these visa things and and also I'm not really drawn to to the country either but. Let's just say if if there was a a good opportunity from there, I would. I would be up to it. But yeah, you know, I just, I don't feel the the extra motivation to do to do it myself, to apply to many places there and and put it there. So yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I totally get. It's a whole logistical challenge and especially if you don't have a green card, it's almost like a lottery based application. So it's just unless you really, really want to go, it's it's the case for some people, it the hassle sometimes isn't even worth it. Yeah, so that is good. OK. 

Speaker 1 

It's not that. 

Speaker 2 

I think. I I'm trying to. I'm looking through if there's anything else I have questions you have any questions for, for me or for Douglas? My manager, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Yes, So what is what? 

Speaker 1 

Is it that your company is doing or like how is this a? I just say, why is it worth for you to to do this or how does? This work. 

Speaker 2 

Sure that that's a good question. So what we do here is as a consultancy, we work with a lot of the main hedge funds and multi strats and propriety trading companies in this space. And essentially we have. Ships with them and we develop partnerships with good candidates like yourself to find who like to build their team. So essentially we will have a partner or a client coming up to us and saying, oh, we need an expert. I don't know in ML and with with history doing Python And so on. And then we go, yeah, we have the perfect calendar for you. We then interact and see if everything works well, and then we guide the candidates to through the process and essentially. We get them to have the job that will suit the best. This is unlike a lot of the recruiters that you might have gotten spamming like myself, you get which are just salesmen, which are basically people with no university degree or just some people that want to make quick money by spamming your CV out to as many companies as possible. And then hopefully one of the companies is gonna. Take you in and it'll get a little Commission for us. It's a much more person driven thing. It's not volume driven, it's quality driven. So we spent a lot of time getting to know people like yourself in detail so that we know exactly what you wanna do, especially after you. Your, your, your, your, your masters or so, yeah, your your studies and all those different things. And so yeah, that's kind of the our business model is really taking great candidates and great clients and finding the connecting them together. 

Speaker 1 

Right. And then I guess you also get some kind. Of Commission cause otherwise. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I mean, yes, so. So the difference is that for us, it's not only just connecting people to to, to clients, but there's been a couple of cases. Which is great. Candidates, usually with more experience in the space they get together and we help seed them into starting their own trading companies like proprietary trading company. So our director actually think about a couple a month ago was able to gather a sitting of 300 million to start their get some. Of our of our client or of our candidates to start their own proprietary trading company. So it's it's not in the sense of a recruiter where all they do is try to get a Commission through that we expand to a lot of things. We also provide business strategy consulting for the firms themselves. So in a lot of sense we. We're not headhunters or we're not recruiters, but rather we're a middleman between the great candidates and and the and the the clients to help them succeed in the space. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, OK. Sounds sounds good. And so how should I expect this to? To work so like. I guess now I'm in your, I don't know database and then. You hit me up if something rises or how does this work? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So I mean, you still have, you're gonna be essentially available from finishing August 2024. So you still have a bit of time. But what we're gonna do, yes, we're gonna save your your profile. Now, I know exactly. Kind of what it is that you want in a job. And I know your experience. I know what kind of person you are, your skills and your. Ground. So we'll keep that in in hand and we'll keep in touch. And whenever something comes up where if you want, want to ask anything from us like about a specific company or whether you should go to let's say I don't know Citadel or Balyasny or Schonfeld or whatever any of the firms that you might be interested. We have we have the the knowledge and we have the context to help you through that process. So it's a, it's not just we're taking something from you, you can also reach me out and I can help you with any. You have but the way we usually go with the kind of that like yourself, that is now about to begin a role is we'll get in touch in around six months, roughly when you're ready into your degree and you have a bit of a knowledge whether you want to still continue with the quant path and then we'll help you with applications since the application usually open around. Yeah, early in the year for the September roles. So we would help you with creating your CV, helping you, preparing for your interviews and kind of guiding you through the entire process. Yeah, does that. Thank you. That sounds good. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah, that sounds good. 

Speaker 2 

Sure. Is there anything else you'd like to to to know or. Yeah, any other questions that you might have? 

Speaker 1 

I mean, how big is this company? You're you're doing is I? I saw it's quite new, right? Like. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So. 

Speaker 1 

One year old. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So it it, I mean, Douglas is on the call, he's the director and the the founder of this company. If he wants to talk a bit more. About the history of this company. 

Speaker 3 

Hi man. How you doing? So how can I help in terms of that information, I think you know Jose done very well be sort of training him as well. Your way knows very much about the space having a degree from Imperial definitely helps. So you know his technical ability is much stronger than than most on the market given his degree which is fantastic. In terms of my background, why I found the company so funnily enough I I originally had a very different background. I spent about 13 years in the music industry. Study at the Cambridge with Miss degree. So I was at kings. Which college are you going to? Did do I see? Look, you go. Are you going to Emmanuel? Actually, it's quite funny. I've got some funny stories about. Just be aware of the Emmanuel all girls drinking club that can that can pose a problem or a delight depending on which way you go. So yeah, and and actually when I was a musician, I applied to manual to be the director of music years and years ago. But Emmanuel should be fun and I think, yeah, you'll definitely, I think being at Imperial, I used to go to the IC bar a lot for work because I I taught around the corner at Royal College of Music. So I I did frequent the icy bar. Quite a lot and and and. Yeah, but, but, you know, imperial and and Cambridge is is very, very different. So I think you'll enjoy it very, very much and you're in one of the colleges down in the central of town. So that's good as opposed to like, you know, Downing or yeah words or something like that. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

So I came to the consultancy space because having spent quite a long time in music, I felt that music education was was was, you know, falling quite a bit. And when I came to consulting, well, you know, I did fairly well just because my. Sort of background and sort of passion is very much for helping people, which in this space unfortunately is not very common. I would say basically non-existent. So Joe can send you my LinkedIn profile. Feel free to add me. And you can also have a look at the reviews we've had. On there so. You know what people say about us. We've done very well. It started off as a family business between myself and my partner who's also a musician, but who also went into consulting space earlier this year. We actually ended up in this sort of bad market because when the market is are are bad. People look less for volume, but for more quality. So for some people like us. Through our quality focused, we did exceptionally well. So we outperformed our our sort of competitors by a factor of about 25 to 500 because we were two people. So you know firms from 50 to thousands, we outperformed them by a factor of 4. To five, which meant. We could heavily expand, but when we were expanding, we were quite. Certain. Well, we were very certain that we did not just want, you know, your run-of-the-mill salespeople. We want people who are passionate about helping people and people who are, who are very highly technical. So that's why we have people like Joe here. We also have Sudhir, who's a pH. D in bioengineering from. Cambridge we've got well, most of the team are Cambridge actually. So another infill in finance from Cambridge as well who used to work at a hedge fund and another and film medieval history. She, you know, quite interested in helping people. So it was quite a switch from medieval history and so forth. So now we have a reputation, even though we're quite young. But myself having, I used to head up the quant section of the global consultancy in Canary Wharf, which had offices in New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, London, of course in Canary Wharf, so. I myself think quite well because in a very short space of time I showed that I actually really care. I cared about the candidates that we worked with, and I also actually learned about the quant space much more than any other person. You know, for example, your background in mathematics is very much your options pricing. So with the background like yours. Usually you would be expected to go to the sell. Side so if. You you've I know you before you've even begun. You've put in, you've put in the modules. Are the modules at Cambridge? Can you do you have choice or are those your set ones? Can you choose alternative models? There are. There are. 

Speaker 1 

Quite a lot of lot of optional modules. So on this machine learning pathway but I guess. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, because for example, if if you really wanted to go into quant space modules like speech recognition, spoken language generation and processing, computer vision probably won't be helpful at all, no. For years, deep learning structure data is practical optimization, potentially probabilistic machine learning. Yes, the other three, so. If if you. Could find other things you know, computational finance, any applications. What's finance? Exposure to larger data sets. Because your background with mathematics is more geared towards market makers and stealth side individuals. If you really want to, bearing in mind that at the end of your masters you'll be competing a lot against a lot of people with, you know, not just one, but two or three internships at you know, Citadel Millennium. Or potentially like Hudson River trading jump trading depending on which side of the coin they they they fall and your even your quantitative research about quantities more and factor factor modeling as opposed to sort of. You know, alpha, your conventional alpha research per say. So if you did want to. Go into the. Quant industry, it's definitely worth. Tailoring your masters in such a way that you can make up for any deficiencies when comparing yourself to a PhD machine, learning or astrophysics or statistical machine learning or computational finance where you might find you know people at Oxford. So for example, they've got. The Oxford Man institute. Cambridge doesn't really have that, and you know, I know imperial certain people and projects at the Alan Turing Institute do do quite well as well. So that would be my advice for you. 

Speaker 1 

Right. Yeah. Thank you very. Much sounds good. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Great. And in terms of, you know, you're welcome to visit us anytime in the office. We're in Aldgate, you you know one thing that's good about here, you can really meet similarly like minded individuals yourselves. So we've expanded from 2:00 to about. We've got sort of 12 people who sort of work, so we've expanded quite heavily self, self funded startup, completely self-sufficient until 2024. If what end of 2024 if no one makes a deal. But you know hopefully they will. That's why we've got little bit of stress currently in the office. That's I think you know, it's also learning and training week, so that's fantastic. But we also actually there's been a lot of interest in working with us. So we've got actually about 9 interns in Oxford and about sort of two or three interns at Durham, which we're thinking about bringing on as well. 

Speaker 1 

Right. Yeah. I mean, this sounds very nice what you're doing and yeah, thank you very much for for the help. And yeah, I'll also be in touch if if anything comes up. 

Speaker 3 

And I think Joe can send you some preparation materials, which I've prepared previously. So definitely do read read for that. I would say do try to stray away from being sort of headhunted by recruiters because recruiters are very bad. If you've got a consultant that you want to work with, that's. Perfect. Ideally us obviously, but if not, that's also fine. But just make sure you actually work with the proper consultant. A lot of the barreled you know Joe can message you later on about the double barred firms and also perhaps send you a link to the wolf of Wall Street video, which sort of really shows their sort of mindset. 

Speaker 2 

I can even if I can just chip in one of the people that I mentioned that I talked to today was someone that finished their masters this year. I forgot which university is it might have been Cambridge as well, and his problem was that he got in talks with recruiters. He wanted to go. Space. And then he got spammed out to a bunch of companies like all the the main names, but he didn't prepare his TV appropriately and so a lot of these companies went completely over over the heads of the people that were hiring. And the thing with the quant space is that once you make an application, let's say to let's say, world quant for example. And if they don't accept you on the first go, and usually it's a several round thing, there's like a one year cool off here where you can't apply there. So it's really important, especially being your first like full time job after you finish your degree to make sure it's done correctly because it's perhaps one of the most important things. Yeah. So it's definitely one of those things to consider. 

Speaker 1 

OK. Just one question cause like a month ago I wanted to, I thought it was time now to apply for position starting let's say next September. But I guess you said that it's enough to do it in like I don't know next beginning of next year, so. Could you like? I don't know. Is it true that now I shouldn't be worried about this at all, like suddenly? 

Speaker 3 

I would say you you have to be efficient about it. So what I would say is you should expect to be ready to interview completely in February by February. So I would say to be safe, January time would be fine. So you should spend the next three months settling into Cambridge, doing some background. Work there are about. Three or four books you definitely should. Should buy. I think the preparation materials that Joe will send over will have the American version of the link, but there are certain books that you certainly buy heard on, heard on the streets, you know, statistical machine learning those like, you know, just your typical textbooks which you should be you know because to be honest. In your case, the masters is useful, but for for another person who might have a computer science or machine learning background from a bachelor's. Having additional masters, if they're not going to do a PhD doesn't really help them in the sector. You know, it's much better to have internships or better to have coding competitions or olympiads or, you know, putting them competitions, that sort of thing. You know that that is a lot more. Let me just. OK. You know what? Let me. Why don't I share with you your typical sort of saying like, OK, let's go. Masters background. Let me just share my screen for a second. 

Speaker 

Yeah, cool. 

Speaker 3 

I can just share. Some profiles with you. So if I move that over there and search it so you can have a look at. These sort of CVS and you can sort. Of tell me what you think. So you know you can see like, OK, math and comes comes out that because you know he does math and computer science. That's more helpful. You know, Internet, citadel securities, you know, national Olympian informatics 4 times Google Kickstart you know code forces rating racing. Masters Singapore mathematics Olympic gold twice you know, and he's actually what we would normally consider weaker candidate. And then, you know ego, for example. Then quantum research at radix trading, one of the best firms out there, five rings, one of the best firms out there, two bronze medals and two silver medals, both in physics and math and and, you know, mathematics, which is quite difficult, not just one. And then obviously, William Putnam, which is a great prize. Bachelors, you know from Princeton, he actually then did a master's and he just finished with Martins at Trinity in Cambridge on mathematics as well. And then he's going to Stanford to do his PhD. But, you know, he got job offers left, right and center. And then let me just show you. So these are just the markers. Profiles that I'm showing you, you know? So then like? Yeah, computer science from Waterloo, Hudson River trading, cedar securities startup explaining snowflake, startup startup tech experience or always quite good. A lot of you know, medalists coding. And you know, just yeah, you can see I TPC like all their first place, you know, competitive programming grandmaster. You know, you can sort of see what I mean and then. You know Sandeep, you know computer science and mathematics. So he's got more of a, you know, coding background as well, potentially actually he's not even, he's not even, he's not even graduated yet. He's graduating 2024, and he's already interned at jump at IMC at Hudson River trading. Luckily, our research, of course, you know, so you can see. Like that's basically. The rough if you're not a PhD, that is the standard for a sort of masters, you know. Candidate having said that, that is for people who don't have our help. So you know your profile is definitely very good. You're branching both mathematics and machine learning, but given that you know their their internships are a lot more alpha and strategy driven than say. What on where you're? Doing more sort of factor modeling. And yeah, so so I would say in terms of you know our value would be really in helping you tailor your process being really aware how you can compete with those. Individuals and where you should compete and where you shouldn't compete. Playing to your strengths, helping with communication, helping with technical preparation, all those sort of things. 

Speaker 1 

Cool. Yeah, sounds great. Thank you. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, perfect. Cool. So I would say I'm keep in contact with Joe or or me add me on LinkedIn if you've got any other questions. Wherever uh, you know, just message either one of us and I would say have a close look at the materials that we sent across to you and sort of vague you. Know do do go through them. Between basically now and. Christmas. Spend your Christmas holiday really relaxing, but then be ready to sort of interview. I would say from January, February onwards. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. Thank you. 

Speaker 3 

OK, perfect. Great. Is do you have any? More questions for me or? 

Speaker 1 

No, no, I think I had all the questions I wanted to ask, so. Right. 

Speaker 3 

Perfect. Great. Well, we'll leave you to it and I'll hand it back to Joe. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. No, I just wanted to thank you again for taking the time to take the call today and I'll send you all the stuff on LinkedIn in just a second. And yeah, please do stay in touch. I'll send you my WhatsApp number in case it's easier to keep touch there, but it's up to you. OK. 

Speaker 1 

OK. Yeah. Thank you guys. 

Speaker 2 

Awesome. No worries. Thank you, Shimon. And we'll keep in touch. 

Speaker 

Right. 

Speaker 2 

Alright. Bye bye. Take care. Enjoy your week. "
